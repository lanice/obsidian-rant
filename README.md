Thin wrapper around the [Rant language](https://rant-lang.org/) Rust crate to be used in Obsidian.

> "**Rant** is a high-level procedural templating language with a diverse toolset for easily creating dynamic code templates, game dialogue, stories, name generators, test data, and much more." - from [Rant's GitHub page](https://github.com/rant-lang/rant)

## Usage

Use a code block with the `rant` type, in which you can enter a Rant program.
The program is then compiled and executed with Rant, and the result shown in the Obsidian preview mode.

Use the command `Re-rant with random seed (active file)` (default hotkey: `Cmd+R`/`Ctrl+R`) to run Rant again on each block in the active (preview) file.

It's also possible to insert a Rant program inline by starting an inline code block with "`rant:`".

Within a `rant` block (both inline and code blocks), the result of the program is then rendered with the Obsidian MarkdownParser.
That means that you can add styling, links, or other markdown-processing elements inside a `rant` block, and they will be rendered accordingly.
In order to avoid Rant syntax errors, you can wrap these elements in double quotes, because Rant treats everything inside double quotes as [string literals](https://docs.rant-lang.org/language/text.html#string-literals), and will not evaluate the content.

You can also embed the result of an existing rant codeblock into any other document or other rant block by using [block links](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks), see [these examples](#embedding-rant-blocks) for details.

## Examples

> **Note:** As Rant chooses random block elements to run, the output of the following examples will vary with each re-run of Rant, so what's shown here is just one possible result.

A Rant program that produces a shuffled deck of cards, taken from the [official Rant examples](https://github.com/rant-lang/rant/tree/master/examples/rant):

````markdown
```rant
[shuffle: 
  [rep: 2] {(Joker)} 
  [cat: **(A;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;J;Q;K); **(♠;♥;♣;♦) |> collect]
]
```
````

Could produce this output (with a random order on each re-rant):

### Inline

An inline Rant program:

````markdown
This inline Rant block is `rant: {neat|awesome|fantastic}`!
````

Result:

### Styling

This is an example of how to apply markdown styling within the Rant code block, note the usage of double quotes:

````markdown
```rant
"**"{Hello|Hi|Hey}"**" world!
```
````
Result:

![Styling example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanice/obsidian-rant/master/img/obsidian-rant-example-styling.png)

### Links

You can use any form of links within a Rant code block, and it properly renders (including page preview on hover):

````markdown
```rant
[rep:10][sep:"-"]{"[[A Page]]"|"[External link](https://www.wikipedia.org)"|Just text}
```
````
Result:

![Link example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanice/obsidian-rant/master/img/obsidian-rant-example-links.png)

### Dice-roller

Example using the [dice-roller plugin](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) within a Rant block:

````markdown
```rant
Suddenly "`dice: 2d4`" {goblins|dragons|gelatinous cubes} charge at you!
```
````
Result:

![Dice-roller example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanice/obsidian-rant/master/img/obsidian-rant-example-dice.png)

### Lists

A Rant program can output lists like this:

````markdown
```rant
A list of all kinds of stuff:\n
[rep:5][sep:\n]{"- [[A page]]"|"- Just text"|"- `dice: 2d12`"}
```
````
Result:

## Embedding Rant Blocks

### Inline

When you have a rant codeblock inside a document called `Programs` that you want to embed in another document, first give it an ID using the `^` notation:

````markdown
```rant
{heads|tails|edge}
```
^coin-flip
````

Then you can embed it like so:

````markdown
Flipping a coin... It landed on `rant: [[Programs#^coin-flip]]`!
````

### Within codeblocks

Inside a rant codeblock, you can import rant codeblocks from other documents by starting the codeblock with `import: [[File#^{block-id}]]` statements.

> Important: `import:` statements can only be used as very first lines in a rant codeblock. Once any line does not begin with `import:`, the regular `rant` program starts, and you can't import anything else. One import per line.

Here is an example, we define rant blocks that define functions, import the block, and call the functions:

````markdown
```rant
[$flip-coin: heads; tails] {
    {<heads>|<tails>}
}
```
^flip-coin

```rant
import: [[Programs#^flip-coin]]

[$flip-coin-with-values] {
    [flip-coin: Heads; Tails]
}
```
^flip-coin-with-values

```rant
import: [[Programs#^flip-coin-with-values]]

"Flipping a coin... "[flip-coin-with-values]!
```
````

As you can see, nested `import`s are supported, so you can import one (or multiple) programs in one block, and then import that block in another, and so on.
